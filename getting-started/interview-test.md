# Interview Task: Hugging Face Agent Project

## 1. Learning & Context

Sign up for the [Hugging Face Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents).

Watch [Karl Haviland's LinkedIn video introduction](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karlhaviland_hf-first-agent-template-agents-course-activity-7298389656415465472-QTQA) to create an agent.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can setup a local python project for development using AI, use git to manage a branch of work, self-start, and follow instructions.  You're given 4-5 days to accomplish as much as you'd like and then would be asked to walk through the code and your idea.  You can be as creative with the project as you'd like.  If there are questions or problems, please reach out immediately, we're happy to work with you!

## 2. Environment Setup

Follow the Haviland Installation and Setup Guide to:
1. Follow the [Installation and Setup Guide](installation-and-setup-guide.md) to create a GitHub account and configure Git version 2.49+ with an SSH key
2. Create the `~/workspaces/hs` directory
3. Install Python 3.11+ and set up a virtual environment
4. Install VSCode or Cursor IDE and enable Copilot
5. Set up the Hugging Face CLI and log into your account

## 3. Project Initialization

1. Create a public repository on both GitHub and Hugging Face.
2. Create a README.md with:
    * Clear description of your agent's purpose
    * Example: "This agent fetches the latest cryptocurrency prices from a public API, loads them into a DataFrame, and can answer questions about market changes."
3. Document project setup:
    * Virtual environment setup instructions
    * List of required packages
    * API access configuration details (if applicable)
    * Agent interaction guide and examples


## 4. Objectives

1. Demonstrate use of Git by:
    * Creating multiple branches for distinct tasks - up to you! (e.g., API setup, data loading, agent integration)
    * Using pull requests to merge change. **Please create pull requests early in the development cycle not at the end.**
    * Feel free to merge branches to main once you feel like a small package of work is finished or assign a resource as reviewer (code doesn't have to be perfect). This will demonstrate you can go through the lifecycle.

2. Demonstrate Python and AI Development
    * Create project following standard Python practices - ie. naming conventions in PEP 8, project structures
    * Use Virtual Environments to install dependencies
    * Calls an API
    * Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame
    * Allows the agent to answer questions about the data

3. Use Copilot/AI tools within your IDE for support during development

4. Demonstrate ability to test your code, no matter how small

5. Communicate documentation and what your project does

6. Show creativity, follow directions, and be a self starter! 

## 5. Model Access Notice

Important: You will need access to a language model (LLM).

    If you already have a license/API key, you may use it.

    Alternatively, Hugging Face provides access to some free LLMsâ€”try those first.

    If you encounter any issues accessing an LLM, contact Karl Haviland immediately for guidance or support.
