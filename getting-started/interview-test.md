# Interview Task: Hugging Face Agent Project

## 1. Learning & Context

    Sign up for the [Hugging Face Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents).

    Watch [Karl Haviland's LinkedIn video introduction](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karlhaviland_hf-first-agent-template-agents-course-activity-7298389656415465472-QTQA) to create an agent.

## 2. Environment Setup

Follow the Haviland Installation and Setup Guide to:
1. Follow the [Installation and Setup Guide](getting-started/installation-and-setup-guide.md) to create a GitHub account and configure Git version 2.49+ with an SSH key
2. Create the `~/workspaces/hs` directory
3. Install Python 3.11+ and set up a virtual environment
4. Install VSCode or Cursor IDE and enable Copilot
5. Set up the Hugging Face CLI and log into your account

## 3. Project Initialization


1. Create a public repository on both GitHub and Hugging Face.
2. Create a README.md with:
    * Clear description of your agent's purpose
    * Example: "This agent fetches the latest cryptocurrency prices from a public API, loads them into a DataFrame, and can answer questions about market changes."
3. Document project setup:
    * Virtual environment setup instructions
    * List of required packages
    * API access configuration details (if applicable)
    * Agent interaction guide and examples


## 4. Development Requirements

1. Demonstrate use of Git by:
    * Creating multiple branches for distinct tasks (e.g., API setup, data loading, agent integration)
    * Using pull requests to merge changes

2. Build an agent that:
    * Calls an API
    * Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame
    * Allows the agent to answer questions about the data

3. Use Copilot/AI tools within your IDE for support during development

## 5. Model Access Notice

Important: You will need access to a language model (LLM).

    If you already have a license/API key, you may use it.

    Alternatively, Hugging Face provides access to some free LLMsâ€”try those first.

    If you encounter any issues accessing an LLM, contact Karl Haviland immediately for guidance or support.
