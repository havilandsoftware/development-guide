# Haviland Software Development Guide

## About this Guide
We want to build and maintain a high quality development team! This guide outlines the various technologies, processes, and development standards we use, and how to get started. The guide is divided into three core sections and each section is expected to be read carefully by all team members (no matter their role :-))!

*NOTE:* This guide is NOT a "Tutorial". Technologies change constantly and those providers spend exponentially more time developing out better tutorials/tech documentation than we can ever maintain.  The learning guide will link out to resources that we feel are best at providing this information.
